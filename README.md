## About

Basic application built using React + Vite to showcase understanding of props and useState hook to display student information given an array of data.

## Work in Progress

Application is very simple and currently just displays all of the student data. I wanted to add some cool functionality so that a user could look up student name and/or date to see specific data that matched results but I had some challenges. Still work in progress!
